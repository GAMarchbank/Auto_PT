Hobby project creating a program to replace a personal trainer.

This project is still a work in progess and more files will be added in the future. 

currently the program will let you create and edit meal plans based upon the biometric information entered by the user. 

i am working on fully noting the code. 

in the future i will be including an option to create exercise plans. 

i also wish to add further complexity to the meal plan generator by using the goals variable to dictate exactly what nutrition appears in meal plans. 


the asda_nut.txt file is the output of the asda scrape program. this is atm not a complete scrape of the asda website so i will be perfecting this program in the future.
