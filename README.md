A large Hobby project to create a personal training program. The intention is that it will have three main funcitons. Firstly it will take the users biometric information and return the correct nutrional information to achieve your goals. Secondly it will allow the user to create meal plans baised upon this nutritional information. These meal plans are able to be edited, updated and saved. The ingredients for these meal plans can be manually created or searched for from a database of supermarket products scraped off the relivant supermarkets websites. If the ingredient was user created then the nutritional information can either be user inputed or call from a nutrional API. The program also contains the ability to calculate the total cost for the meal plan by calculating how much you wil need of each ingredient and the total costs of these amounts. Thirdly the program will create exercise plans using databases of exercises scraped from the internet. This third section has yet to be written. 

This project is still a work in progess and more files will be added in the future. 

I am working on fully noting the code. 

I also wish to add further complexity to the meal plan generator by using the goals variable to dictate exactly what nutrition appears in meal plans. 


the asda_nut.txt file is the output of the asda scrape program. this is atm not a complete scrape of the asda website so i will be perfecting this program in the future.
